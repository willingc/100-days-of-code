# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: 2020-11-28 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
HTML, CSS Refresher. Selectors. Flexbox and positioning.

**Thoughts:**
Lots of details. Different type of selectors. CSS hierarchy makes
more sense now. Finding a good cheatsheet for html elements and
CSS hierarchy would be helpful.

**Link to work:**
Handwritten notes. Will scan into image.

## Day 1: 2020-11-29 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

- Explore [Julia site](https://julialang.org/)
- Static Site Generator [Franklin](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) and [Franklin templates](https://github.com/tlienart/FranklinTemplates.jl)
- Explore [Literate.jl](https://fredrikekre.github.io/Literate.jl/v2/)
- Checkout [Documenter.jl](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/)

**Thoughts:**

The Julia ecosystem has grown significantly since [JuliaCon 2017](https://juliacon.org/2017/).
It's great that there are more tools for documentation and
teaching available to support sharing the language.

Cool tip to get into `Pkg` mode: type `]`
To get back to REPL, use backspace or Ctl-c.

Fork IJulia

**Thoughts:**

Packaging has really improved since 2017 and it's nice to have tools to
sort and review packages and info about them.
